# Music Helper

This project intend to offer to new musicians (or any musician without deep theorical knowledge) an opportunity to compose music with complex concepts.

MusicHelper contain a complex metronome, a scales cheat sheet with a Circle of Fifhts, and a progression helper linked to the previous Circle of Fifths



## Metronome

MusicHelper's metronome particularity is to be able to understand any time signature that come to your mind. It also allows to change time signature each bar.
This first version has minor lags (<10ms). Reason is Metronome's main role is not being a "play-along" metronome, but more an help visualize time signature changes through the tablature.

## Scales

## Circle of Fifhts

## Progressions
